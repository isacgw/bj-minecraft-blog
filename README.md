### Why did I make this project?

For two reasons mainly. I wanted to make something with NextJS and I've also been wanting to do a project using
a headless CMS. A blog page seemed like a good option. But instead of making it a boring, unpersonal blog with
filler content I thought why not make something fun of it? So my friends and I will use this page to update our
progress in our Minecraft realm, like a journal kind of. This also gives me a reason to in the future improve and
add features to the site.

### What did I learn?

How great NextJS is! I absolutely love working with it, it just feels like the evolved version of React. 
Also using a CMS to create content on a page is something I will definitely make use of in the future. One thing I 
immediately thought of while I was working on this was "oh I have to make my portfolio using this". It was also the first time
I used Tailwind CSS. I've never actually used a CSS library in any of my projects before because, well, I've been wanting to
practice CSS/SCSS which I maybe prefer but I for sure see why people like CSS libraries and in this case Tailwind. The more I worked
with it and started to understand it the more I started to appreciate it. So to summarize, I see GraphCMS and Tailwind CSS as added 
tools to my toolbox that I will 100% use in the future to solve problems.

### Future improvements:

In the future I'd like to add a sorting function as the blog will grow and the articles become more.
